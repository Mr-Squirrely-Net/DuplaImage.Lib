DuplaImage.Lib is a .NET standard library offering several different perceptual hashing algorithms for detecting similar or duplicate images.

## Downloads

DuplaImage.Lib is available as a [Nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DuplaImage.Lib). 
You can laso donwload the Nuget packages from the [releases page](https://github.com/MrSquirrely/DuplaImage.Lib/releases).

## Features

DuplaImage.Lib implements the following perceptual hash algorithms:

- ### Average
  - Calculates the hash based on the average value of scaled down image. More in-depth explanation of the algorithm can be found [here](http://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/432-Looks-Like-It.html). Extremely fast algorithm, but generates a lot of false positives. Can generate 64 or 256 bit hashes.
- ### Median
  - Similar to average, but instead of average pixel value, median value is used. This should make the algorithm bit more resistant to non-linear changes in image. Slightly slower than average hash. Can generate 64 or 256 bit hashes
- ### Difference
  - Constructs the hash by comparing the gradients of pixel values on each row of the scaled image. In-depth explanation found [here](http://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/529-Kind-of-Like-That.html). Performs faster than the average hash and provides better results. Produces 64 or 256 bit hashes.
- ### DCT (pHash)
  - Discrete cosine transform based algorithm. Similar to the one implemented in [pHash library](http://www.phash.org/). Detailed explanation of the algorithm can be found [here](http://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/432-Looks-Like-It.html). Slower than any of the previous algorithms, but has better tolerance to image modifications. Produces 64 bit hashes.

All algorithms accepts the image input as a stream or as a path to filesystem location.

DuplaImage.Lib also provides a function to compare hashes to return the similarity of the hashes.

DuplaImage.Lib uses [Magick.NET](https://github.com/dlemstra/Magick.NET) for image processing needs. Users of DupImageLib can use their own image processing library by providing an implementation of IImageTransformer and passing that to the ImageHashes constructor.

## Usage

### Example

```csharp
// Create new ImageHashes instance using ImageMackick as image manipulation library
var imageHasher = new ImageHashes(new ImageMagickTransformer());
// Calculate 64 bit hashes for the images using difference algorithm
var hash1 = imageHasher.CalculateDifferenceHash64(@"testimage1.png");
var hash2 = imageHasher.CalculateDifferenceHash64(@"testimage2.png");
// Calculate similarity between the hashes. Score of 1.0 indicates identical images.
var similarity = ImageHashes.CompareHashes(hash1, hash2);
```
